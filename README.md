Q: What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
A: getElementById is used to get an element via ID; getElementsByClassName is used to get an element via class name, which is used in CSS; and querySelector is used to select an element via class or ID, but you have to define the word like in CSS, such as .test or #test, but it will return the 1st element. If there is no element, it will return null. On the other hand, querySelectorAll is the same as querySelector, but it will return an array. If there is no element, it will return an empty array []
